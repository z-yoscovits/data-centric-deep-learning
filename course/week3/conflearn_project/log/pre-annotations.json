My induction rechargeable toothbrush has a better set up; it has lasted for 6 years and is still going strong.  Come on Clarisonic - I am not the only one who has brought this topic up.

The bristles are gentle on the skin, yet provide a thorough, deep pore cleansing.  The rotating head vibrates enough to be effecting, but not so fast that it feels like a grinding wheel and the entire package is easy to hold in your palm.  Great for control and being easy to reach all the areas of your face. The motor is powerful and does not get bogged down and the charge lasts a really long time. It has two speeds - one for extra gentle - but she rarely uses this speed.  Plus the entire package is waterproof.  To charge, just rest it in the cradle charger provided.\n\nMy wife like to use her preferred cleanser (not a bar of soap). Her recommendation is to keep the brush head clean and dry when not in use.  In other words, don't use it, put it down and just walk away.  Keep the head clean and make sure it dries really well between use.  She sets hers bristle down on a folded sheet of paper towel.

By now you know that I am not only a licensed Hair stylist and Makeup Artist to some of the biggest names, but I am one of the most trusted on product knowledge. You also know that I am not paid for endorsements and I'm unbiased. Moroccan Oil was exciting when it first launched at our industry trade show, Premiere, in Orlando, Fl. They had demo's on the spot, and handed out mini sample bottles to everyone with their grubby little hands out, mine included. As I researched this product and its ingredients a little deeper, I discovered that it is only a subtle, temporary fix for giving a little smoothing effect to the hair. There is no long term benefits from using this product. Don't waste your money. Yes, it smells nice, but it's not what it claims to be. No, I'm not hating on Moroccan Oil. There is nothing wrong with using it if you are just looking for a subtle and temporary fix and don't mind spending the money. You could get better results with pure organic coconut oil (used in small amounts). Now that I've told you the truth about this product, I will be honest and say I love their hairsprays and glimmer shine spray. You'll have to read those reviews there. If you want an alternative to this oil, Orofluido is much better, smells better and has more lasting results. Be sure to read my reviews before purchasing any hair product.

I warm it up in my fingers and dab a little on my eyelid and smooth it over for a nice clean base. It makes eyeshadow stand out even more; they look more pigmented, rich, and they are easy to blend and last all day. It goes on creamy but it feels matte after you apply it, which is a nice change from other primers that feel too wet at times. A little definitely goes a long way with this primer, and it covers up any coloring or veins I have on my eyelids. I find that it also helps with under eye circles, so some mornings I just dab a little of that under my eyes instead of concealer. Just don't use too much! I've not had any bad reactions with wearing it, and I tend to have sensitive eyes with wearing contacts (and also with the spring allergies).\n\nHowever...\nThe Bad: I will say that while being matte is awesome, sometimes my eyelids feel incredibly dry if I use it too frequently. It dries incredibly fast so you have to apply it quickly. I just take my middle finger and do a circular motion in the pot to help warm it on my fingertip and do one eye at a time. I also think it'd be helpful if it came in two more shades. I have light skin and use the Taffy, but I can still see the color of the primer on my lid. This isn't a huge issue since eyeshadow layers on top, but I have to careful not to blend it out too far. I think if they had one shade lighter and darker it'd make it a much more versatile range of primers.\n\nOverall, I'm very pleased with this primer. I'm a fan of Stila makeup and it works very wells for me.\n\nEdit-\nI've been using this primer for much longer now and have to change my opinion on some things and my rating from 4 stars to 2. I had said before that my eyelids felt really dry afterwards. Well, this product is definitely not for continuous use. I can only use it maybe once a week! Otherwise my eyelids literally feel rough, itchy, and kind of crackly. It won't bother me after wearing it all day, but if I use it 2-3 days in a row, forget it. The price is too high for something I can only use 1-2 times a week. Plus who wants their eyelids to hurt?! I still think that the payoff is pretty great and that my shadows look great and don't crease.

It went on much smoother than the masks I am accustomed to using.  It felt creamier and got into difficult areas around nose and creases in neck.  Drying time really depends on oil content of your skin.  It actually took about 12 minutes to totally dry on my face, especially around my nose where I have high oil concentration.  It came off quite smoothly in the shower and did not get stuck in hairy areas of my mustache, eyebrows, and hair line.  It did provide me with an invigorating tingling feeling that I enjoy and seemed to remove blackheads well.\n\n\"The only thing prohibitive of regular usage would be the cost.

There are not very many hair dryers like that on the market except ones specifically geared towards my demographic (if you know what I mean). So, this hair dryer fit the bill. When I received the package I initially tested it out and the first thing I noticed was the awesome comb attachment. It is made of durable plastic and the pik's teeth are thick and seem to be well constructed. I don't think you'll have a problem with comb breaking at all. Now as for the hair dryer itself, it is a fail. The hair dryer is a very pretty red color and is relatively quiet but its very awkward to hold in your hands for a long period of time. It felt like my hands were sliding off of the handle, not to mention the control buttons are right on the area where you would hold the dryer - definitely annoying. The hair dryer also doesn't seem to get very hot. I need major heat and this was just so-so. I had an Andis dryer before and while my Andis is only 1875 watts it seemed to get my hair much more straighter. I have now purchased the Allure 2200 Watt Hair Dryer sold here on amazon http://www.amazon.com/Allure-2200w-Professional-Ionic-Ceramic/dp/B00SKQFT4I and it has worked surprisingly well for me. My drying time has went down to only 12 minutes. Plus the comb attachment from the Hot Tools dryer fits perfectly on this one.

I didn't realize how much I touch my hair until this product. After a while, it made me look forward to washing it out. To help others on their quest, I'll note that I've tried two other products. ColorMark, which is like a marker, is ok but after applying enough to cover silver in some spots it got a bit cakey. So so coverage otherwise and time consuming. For me the first thing I bought at Bed Bath and Beyond, EverPro Gray Away, which is what I call a colored hairspray is the easiest and provides best coverage. Not sure of color match if my hair wasn't dark brown/black. But works best for me without grit or cake build up, quick application, and fairly full coverage.

I'm a big fan of Reuzel and I use several of their products everyday.  The Beard Foam (and the Beard Balm) are the first Reuzel products I have ever been disappointed with.\n\nThe directions on the label instruct to apply this product to a clean, towel dried beard (I normally use beard oil in this manner). The problem is that this product contains no natural oils, only a bunch of unnecessary chemicals. The only up side is that it also contains Reuzel's T-4 Tonic Blend which is beneficial. But your beard needs more than just that. It needs natural oils and conditioners, not all the chemicals.  I prefer the results I get with all natural products.  My beard is softer, healthier and more manageable when using my regular products.\n\nMy regular routine consists of a quality beard oil right out of the shower, massaging it into the skin and brushing it through the hair with a boar bristle brush. I let the oil absorb while I tend to other things.  A few minutes later I apply a beard balm that contains Shea Butter, Mango Seed Butter, Lanolin, Apricot Kernel Oil, Jojoba Seed Oil, Beeswax, and Cocoa Seed Butter. Then at the end I apply a little beard wax to provide the hold. This gives me a soft, healthy, manageable beard without any chemicals and no long term hair damage. The results of my routine are far superior to the Reuzel Beard Foam & Beard Balm combo.\n\nOkay, the scent...  I know full well that smells are subjective, but... this Beard Foam STINKS!!  At first it smells like soap, --so far so good-- BUT then it goes through a bad breath stage, which progresses into to a plastic/rubbery smell, then it finally settles into a powdery scent, similar to the Beard Balm.  This powdery scent then lingers on, and on, and on, and on...  I personally HATE  powdery smells, so if you're like me avoid the Beard Foam (and the Beard Balm, it's even worse).  However, if you're one of those weirdos that actually wants to smell like a big 'ol powder puff, well... you're going to love it.\n\nSpeaking to the 'deodorizing' properties, I suppose if you just finished eating your girlfriend's second-hand tuna sandwich the Beard Foam may provide a slight improvement to your beard's smell.

The gloss isn't sticky or shimmery, it's just enough to hydrate your lips. I wear it in the morning, and again at night time, and I haven't had to exfoliate my lips since I started using this product. My lips feel plump and smooth all day long.

I never bought any because of the price, and, I am not all that self conscious about my balding anyway.  However when a good friend of mine got some for his thinning hair I was so impressed by how it good it looked that I begged him to let me use it just once.  The color wasn't exactly right but that didn't matter since it was only a test... Unfortunately I have to say that even though it worked very well on my friends hair that is only thinning, it was a total bomb for me who has a real beach head coming in on the top.  Quite simply, one has to pay very close attention to the description of how this stuff says it works.  It clearly states that it needs or works by bonding with your existing hair.  If you have either no, or hardly any existing hair, it just comes out looking like a lot of very homely fuzzy stuff.  I tried it all over the top of my head and it simply stuck to it, and then ended up looking like some kind of very short, fuzzy, sparsely covered type dog hair.  Very ugly and fake looking and not at all worth the price or the bother for sure....\n\nAs for how it worked for my friend I have nothing but praise.  It was amazing the way it blended in and stuck to what thinning hair he had and combed out looking completely natural.  If you really want to see how this stuff looks in use, type the name of it into google and go to videos.  There are several online that depict a true demonstration of how good this stuff works on thinning hair.  Even on very thinning hair.  But not a one I found showed someone with a real Dr. Phil look, or even just a completely bare bald spot.  Without some minimal hair to cling to you are like me, fresh out of luck and too late.  If my hair was only thinning I would consider the hefty price of this worth it I believe.  Just remember for the truly bald, its a bust...\n\nIn conclusion, I decided to take off one star on the rating simply because I feel that despite this working very well on thinning hair, I believe that the description should more forcefully state that its not for bald heads. I don't think it does clearly enough to satisfy me. Not even the manufacturers web site that has a more detailed description says anything about bald heads.  Personally I feel that the majority of the negative reviews of it comes from those that are too far ahead with hair loss and just came out with a big fail on their part.  It was with me for sure.  Highly recommended only  for those with thinning hair that this stuff can cling too, and that feel hiding it well is worth the price... : )"}, "predictions": [{"result": [{"value": {"choices": ["Negative"]}, "id": "data-56091", "from_name": "sentiment", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices"}]}]}, {"data": {"text": "Does Mason Pearson ever wonder what's happening to all his brushes?

It's one of the things I admire and pride myself about my body. One day during finals week (I'm guessing excessive stress made this happen) but I got a pimple. It hurt so bad and was huge. When I do (rarely) get a pimple, you can barely see them because I treat them before and during its early emergence on my face. Somehow, I came across (Please don't publicly shame me when I say this) an Instagram post on Yahoo of a Kylie Jenner snapchat of how she treats her face for acne. Due to that snapchat and my desperation, I forked over $16 on this drying lotion. Why did I do that? This stuff just chemically burns the crap out of my face, left the area peeling, and left behind a dark case of hyper-pigmentation. My skin isn't even that sensitive. Never again will I buy something like this to put on my face. I'll stick to the basics that have always worked for me.\n\nHere's what works for me if you're curious: I get almost all of this stuff on amazon\n-A gentle cleanser (cetaphil or neutrogena)\n-Oil cleansing every now and then (olive oil and castor oil with a few drops of Trader Joe's tea tree oil are my faves)\n-ACV mixed with water as a toner or Burt's Bees tomato toner\n-Tea tree oil and clean and clear's persa-gel ( to treat bumps and pimples )\n**I've learned that if you really want to have nice skin, you have to protect it and keep it moisturized. Also keep your routine SIMPLE**\n-Olay Total effects 7 in one SPF 30 or Olay Complete for Combination/Oily skin SPF 15 in the am (depends on the season)\n-Olay Regenerist Night Cream in the pm or SR Luna Oil with SR Good Genes serum\n\n(The only non-drug store things I use on my face are Sunday Riley's Luna Oil and Good Genes serum. They're pretty darn good!!! The Luna Oil also has certain antiseptic properties that help prevent acne! Crazy right?! It also makes my skin so soft! The serum is good for hyper-pigmentation and brightening skin. Both of them do many other things too! Sephora has a duo kit for $78. It was a birthday gift to myself! I work on campus! Don't judge! As a college student, I often times don't get as much sleep that I'm suppose to and I was afraid that it would start showing in my face even though the saying is \"Black don't crack\". I got this duo to help prevent premature aging. #wrinkles #bags #Crowsfeet #SayNoToFillers #SayNoToBotox #AgeGraciously)\n\n***Side Note: I use to have really bad oily skin. In early high school, I would dry it out with acne astringents and skip out on moisturizer at night because I didn't want my face to be really oily. Eventually, I realized that my face was overproducing oils because of this behavior. The moment I started using gentle cleansers, oils, and moisturizers, the moment my skin realized it didn't need to drown itself in sebum. As I go through my day, I still do produce oil on my skin but it's not excessive. It's just a healthy amount to protect my face from the harsh environment and create a healthy glow. During the warmer months, I walk around with a pack of oil blotting sheets just in case.\n\nI hope this helped someone! I know it was a lot to read. Also, use smile.amazon.com to make your purchases!

Say goodbye to razor bumps and ingrown hairs FOREVER! Trust me- I've tried dozens of pricey face washes, shaving creams, and after shaves over the last 4 years.

Does the product work? Yes. Is it any more effective than other products which espouse anti-aging through hyaluronic acid? No. On top of that, it does not even seem to moisturize especially well. As someone who has used hyaluronic acid serum for years, I really was expecting this formulation to be an improvement over other products, ESPECIALLY at this price point. It totally was not. In fact, I've found that I prefer the common hyaluronc acid serums you can find everywhere these days. They are:\n\n1) Much cheaper and easier to find\n2) Cosmetically elegant / apply well with other products\n3) Can be DIY'ed\n\nI notice a lot of people who have started using this at the recommendation of their dermatologist or surgeon. Hyaluronic acid (sodium hyaluronate) is amazing because it is a hydrophilic (water-loving) molecule that binds H2O and is naturally present in skin and other soft tissues. It lubricates joints, eyes, and can hold 1000 times it's own weight in H2O. Skin that is abundant in hyaluronic acid is better able to hold moisture and look plump - and diminish wrinkles. If you have never used hyaluronic acid aside from this product, and you'd prefer not to spend $100 for 2oz, TRY a generic hyaluronic acid serum first.

To my nose it has more in common with the scent of dryer sheets than the kind of fragrance I am drawn to.  Very little silage, but it is quite long lasting on the skin.

Drying time really depends on oil content of your skin.  It actually took about 12 minutes to totally dry on my face, especially around my nose where I have high oil concentration.  It came off quite smoothly in the shower and did not get stuck in hairy areas of my mustache, eyebrows, and hair line.

As some one who has had melanoma, skin protection from UVA/UVB is very important to me - more important than anti-aging. However, I figured since this product has both I would see how I liked it. I don't. First some things that I did like:\n\nPros:\n- (so far) has not caused a reaction to my skin, which other sun screen/sun block lotions can sometimes do\n- the tint - on me, anyway - seems to blend in okay with my skin coloring. Not too light, not too dark, not too \"orange.\"\n- this does make the imperfections in my skin seem much less noticeable, and provides a smooth skin tone\n- it promises a SPF 50, which is probably more than adequate for facial protection\n- it has a matte finish, no \"shininess.\"\n\nCons:\n- this product is the consistency of toothpaste. As recommended, I tried rubbing it in my hands to \"soften,\" but that did not work and it was an enormous bother.\n- because of the consistency of the product, putting it on my skin was not easy. I had to really rub it in to get it to absorb and blend - and pulling / tugging on delicate facial skin certainly doesn't aid in the aging process.\n- once it is on my skin I feel as though I have a mask on. While it doesn't feel heavy, exactly, it feels as though my skin has a layer over it.\n- this could possibly make a very good sun screen - except the instructions state it must be added every 2 hours. I can only imagine what this would feel like after several applications.\n- after putting this product on my face, it is very difficult to wash off my hands and fingers - even with hot water and soap.\n\nOverall, while this product may be very effective at blocking UVA/UVB, I simply do not like the way it makes my skin feel. I normally do not wear facial make-up - just moisturizer and sun screen - so having something that feels \"cake-y\" and like a mask feels too strange. Also, my face does feel as though it is moisturized, and that is important to me, being in my mid-50s. I could see this being a great product if I were on a hike or spending quite a bit of time in the sun. But, then the heavy, paste-like substance makes the prospect uninviting. I would be more inclined to wear a moisturizer with SPF 15 or 30 and to wear a hat.

There are 2 reasons I'm giving it 2 stars instead of 5. I absolutely hate the fact DDF threw in a few cheap fillers. The two that annoy me the most in this formulation are menthol and witch hazel. I get that it's a cost reduction strategy for the company and they probably thought buyers would be duped into finding it beneficial. Some people love that cooling sensation Menthol brings.\n\nBut for a rosacea-prone girl like me with sensitive skin, it is a BIG con. These ingredients cause a lot more irritation than necessary. Glycolic Acid in itself irritates my skin. I definitely need it though in order to have smooth texture. And the redness usually does subside within minutes. Menthol and Witch Hazel added in however, leave me with inflamed skin for about an hour. I might not be so irked by this, if it weren't for the fact I *know* both are slowly drying my skin's moisture barrier out over time.\n\nThere are better glycolic acid toners on the market in terms of formulation and price.

I am considering other alternatives.\n\n--\n\nFYI - price estimate: If you are doing your arms in addition to the rest of your body (my arm hair is white so it would have no effect, as is the hair on my outer thighs) then I would guess one cartridge would give you one and a half passes for arms, underarms, legs and bikini.  You'd probably need 6 total to do your entire body the recommended number of times (I believe it's first four treatments 2 weeks apart, next three treatments 3-4 weeks apart, and then treatments as needed and only in specific areas, but it is all in the book you get with the kit), and then another 1-2 for any extra maintenance or trouble areas that may be causing trouble, so that gives you a better idea of pricing overall.\n\n--\n\nDay 1 - January 4: \"All I know is I got shot by a laser. Gosh darnit, my *censored* hurts. You're right about it being like a rubber band.\" -Boyfriend wanted to use it, too. He shot my legs, underarms, and bikini area. It actually melted any stubble so I believe it was working the right way. Make sure you shave the day before. He used the 5 the whole time on me, per my request, as I read a lot of reviews that said it only works at that level. It really did feel like a rubber band. Basically the softer tissue was when it hurt. I hardly felt it on my legs or stomach, mostly just my inner thighs. I also felt it around my knees while they were bent, but when I stretched out it was fine (book says don't laser skin that's not tight, so this is apparently why). We are thinking about the white eyeliner tip for round 2, as one of the issues was it was very hard to keep track of where we were. Thus far, it didn't seem to cause any irritation. Best part: the sound effects. Pew pew!\n\nDay 2 - January 20: Thus far, I've noticed I definitely had to shave in between.  My hair was still growing, and it was still coming in with no noticeable difference - to me.  However, not to be discouraged, we tried again!  Online articles said to expect only 10% of hair gone for any sort of laser hair removal.  During the process, my boyfriend used the singed bits of stubble as a sort of guide, and he also pressed down a bit harder as he went to leave a minor impression and keep track of where he had been.  We did my legs (only the inside of my thighs and then all of my lower legs) and under my arms, and then he also shot a few areas on his body.  He said that not a lot of hair has grown back from the areas he did.  One spot was a mole, but I did still notice a couple hairs.  He did one of my underarms twice on accident, so we'll compare the two and see if this is a positive strategy - that's for next time!  Keep you posted. (Also, the light is quite bright.  I hid my head under a blanket both this time and last, and my boyfriend was wearing sun glasses.  One of the other reviewers said they bought special glasses.  I don't think it's necessary for such a small procedure, but if you're doing multiple people or for some reason will need way more treatments or if you're actually doing your entire body, then at least wear sun glasses but please consider special glasses.  Come on, it's your eyes.)\n\nDay 3 - January 26: I don't really see a difference, but it's only the third treatment now. It may be my imagination, but some of the hair seemed thinner.  The instructions say to go every two weeks for the first few treatments, but my hair was starting to grow back and I had to shave Friday for the weekend, so we decided to have at it.  Hopefully my last $10 razor purchase!  My boyfriend said there was a noticeable difference between my two underarms, so I suppose it was a happy accident that we did one twice.  It meant a lot more overlap where the laser hit, which is where I think the real benefit was.  Because of this, he did both of my underarms twice today.  However, please note I DO NOT recommend doing this as it did leave minor burn marks after the second time, and the second time also hurt and felt burning - but come on, if you're zapping your skin on highest intensity TWICE then you better expect it!  However, it really just looks reddish, and it's just under my arms so no one sees it anyway.  A little lotion or aloe and it will be fine.  Also, I could smell the burning hair.  I definitely would NOT do my legs that way! We made it through one lower leg and then had to switch the laser cartridge to the second one. (Two per initial box.)  So, that means that one cartridge made it down both my legs twice (plus one more leg) and under my arms twice, and then did my bikini line twice and a couple spots on my boyfriend twice.  I have some BAD NEWS, though.  The little laser got really hot - which is part of the reason it burned me a bit more today and hurt more than it had before - and then it stopped working.  We were not misusing it, so I believe it was just a defective unit.  It's not a big deal since Amazon's return policy is solid.  I am going to send it back for a refund rather than a replacement because I don't know if it is really working or not.  However, if it is actually working, I will buy a new one and get back on it!  I'm going to give it two weeks and then reevaluate the status of my hair.  It sounds silly but I took a picture of my underarm today so I can actually compare.\n\nFinal update: After a series of three photos (the final a month after returning the device), I realized there was little to no hair loss.

I warm it up in my fingers and dab a little on my eyelid and smooth it over for a nice clean base. It makes eyeshadow stand out even more; they look more pigmented, rich, and they are easy to blend and last all day. It goes on creamy but it feels matte after you apply it, which is a nice change from other primers that feel too wet at times. A little definitely goes a long way with this primer, and it covers up any coloring or veins I have on my eyelids. I find that it also helps with under eye circles, so some mornings I just dab a little of that under my eyes instead of concealer. Just don't use too much! I've not had any bad reactions with wearing it, and I tend to have sensitive eyes with wearing contacts (and also with the spring allergies).\n\nHowever...\nThe Bad: I will say that while being matte is awesome, sometimes my eyelids feel incredibly dry if I use it too frequently. It dries incredibly fast so you have to apply it quickly. I just take my middle finger and do a circular motion in the pot to help warm it on my fingertip and do one eye at a time. I also think it'd be helpful if it came in two more shades. I have light skin and use the Taffy, but I can still see the color of the primer on my lid. This isn't a huge issue since eyeshadow layers on top, but I have to careful not to blend it out too far. I think if they had one shade lighter and darker it'd make it a much more versatile range of primers.\n\nOverall, I'm very pleased with this primer. I'm a fan of Stila makeup and it works very wells for me.\n\nEdit-\nI've been using this primer for much longer now and have to change my opinion on some things and my rating from 4 stars to 2. I had said before that my eyelids felt really dry afterwards. Well, this product is definitely not for continuous use. I can only use it maybe once a week! Otherwise my eyelids literally feel rough, itchy, and kind of crackly. It won't bother me after wearing it all day, but if I use it 2-3 days in a row, forget it. The price is too high for something I can only use 1-2 times a week. Plus who wants their eyelids to hurt?! I still think that the payoff is pretty great and that my shadows look great and don't crease.

Lip exfoliation is one of the simplest, most inexpensive beauty routines one can engage in at home because it only requires two basic ingredients that virtually every household has on hand: sugar and oil.\n\nSpecifically, all that is required to exfoliate the lips is a tiny amount of granular sugar, either white table sugar (sucrose as in this product), brown sugar,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/raw-sugar/dp/B000EA3M4M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">raw sugar</a>, or sugar alcohol such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/xylitol/dp/B001EO6852/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">xylitol</a>. Add to that an equal amount of any food-grade oil you have on hand in the house, for example: olive oil, canola oil, safflower oil, or coconut oil. One-fourth teaspoon each of granular sugar and oil is enough to do both lips.\n\nThe instructions for do-it-yourself exfoliation are as follows:\n\nIn a small bowl or saucer, measure out one-fourth teaspoon of granular sugar. On top of it put an equal amount of oil. Wash your hands and dry them thoroughly. Blend the sugar and oil together with the tip of your finger. Rub the sugar-oil mixture onto your lips in a circular motion for two-five minutes. Gently scrub off the mixture with a clean, damp washcloth to remove not only the sugar and oil, but any loosened, dead skin. If flaking, dead skin still remains on your lips, rub more of the sugar-oil mixture onto your lips and repeat the above process. After you are finished, immediately moisturize your lips, ideally with a natural, food-grade oil or a lip balm made with an oil-beeswax mixture, since anything that goes on the lips ultimately ends up in the mouth and stomach.\n\nThe second problem with this product is that even though the container looks small, there is enough of this product to last a very long time. And while it is sitting on your bathroom shelf, it is slowly drying out. Within six months to a year, long before you've used more than a fraction of it, this product will deteriorate into a hard, unusable lump (not to mention that most cosmetics companies recommend throwing out their products anyway within six to nine months because of inevitable bacteria buildup). If you make your own sugar-oil mixture each time you need it, nothing is wasted, and it is always fresh, with a smooth, viscous consistency that glides onto your lips.\n\nThe third problem with this product is that, though some of the ingredients are natural and food-grade, others are not. The ingredients for this product include: \"Sucrose, Petrolatum, Flavor, Caramel, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, VitiVinifera (Grape) Seed Oil.\" Below is a description of each ingredient. The most problematic one is petrolatum. It is too bad that the makers of this product didn't just stick to grapeseed oil, which is a natural, healthy oil.\n\nSucrose is simple white/table sugar.\n\nPetrolatum: This lab-derived substance has been around since 1859 when chemist Robert Chesebrough developed a method of purifying a black gel that clogged oil rigs called \"rod wax.\" This is a very thick substance which is anything but ideal for exfoliating the skin.\n\nFlavor: It is not specified whether this is \"artificial\" or \"natural\" flavor. Artificial flavor is derived from non-food substances, that is, chemicals created in a lab. Natural flavor is derived from a real food, but the process by which it is derived is unexplained. In both cases, there is no way to know how safe or healthy the flavoring is.\n\nCaramel: This is sugar or syrup heated until it turns brown. It can either be used as a coloring agent or to impart flavor.\n\nJojoba oil is a natural plant oil. It is created from the liquid wax of the seed of the jojoba plant, a shrub which is native to southern Arizona, southern California, and northwestern Mexico. It's much healthier than petrolatum, but it contains 14% erucic acid, which is not recommended to be taken internally.\n\nGrapeseed oil is a natural oil derived from the seeds of grape. It contains vitamin E and antioxidants."}, "predictions": [{"result": [{"value": {"choices": ["Positive"]}, "id": "data-34809", "from_name": "sentiment", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices"}]}]}, {"data": {"text": "This just smell good, that's all I can say."}, "predictions": [{"result": [{"value": {"choices": ["Positive"]}, "id": "data-13350", "from_name": "sentiment", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices"}]}]}, {"data": {"text": "I think it's okay?

Why? Because after a week and less than 1/4 of the can used, the entire spray nozzle has failed. It's not clogged or blocked. It has simply stopped working. This happened as I was in the middle of preparing for a formal wedding at 5pm on a Saturday night at a country resort in the middle of nowhere. I couldn't run out and buy a new can of hair spray and I had to borrow some from the bride!!! Never again.\n\n***************** Original Review below **************************************************\nI use hair spray every single day and I have been trying to find a single good brand that does the job off my current two brands. I have settled on Suave for the days when I am outside with the horses in the wind, dust and humidity simply because it is inexpensive and my hair stays put. But the trade off is I can't run a brush through my hair after spraying it and it can get dry in the summer. My second option has been Fekkai brand which is excellent, smells pretty, and holds well, yet feels soft & I can brush my hair and it still looks great. But....Fekkai is outrageously overpriced and hard to justify & the nozzles don't always work.\n\nThis CHI Keratin has a mild and not unpleasant scent, sprays out in a wide, fine mist and doesn't feel sticky. My hair feels soft and looks nice - the same way it does with the Fekkai and I can brush it for touch ups. If I use a bit more than when I use the Suave, I get a similar strong hold in a wind outside and humidity. On a normal day or if I am going to be inside only, a light spritz of the CHI is all I need.

You can feel them going over your skin and if there were more of them, I think my opinion of this product would be different.  But as it is now, a large percentage of your skin is never going to come into contact with one of the seeds as you use this, so most of your skin will not be exfoliated.  Since this is marketed as a scrub, that's a problem.\n\nThis is gentle and non-irritating when used a few times a week.  If you have sensitive skin and have had trouble with microdermabrasion-type scrubs, this could still work for you.  Please note that it has alpha hydroxy acids and so should be used in combination with a sunscreen.  It does rinse off cleanly and without leaving residue, as well.\n\nFor what it's worth, I'm having more breakouts with this than before I used it.  I don't necessarily think it is causing the breakouts, but the less-effective exfoliation (as opposed to my previous scrub product) is slowing turnover of my skin cells, which is what's causing my problems.\n\nIn the end, this may be worth a try if you have really sensitive skin.

I'm a big fan of Reuzel and I use several of their products everyday.  The Beard Foam (and the Beard Balm) are the first Reuzel products I have ever been disappointed with.\n\nThe directions on the label instruct to apply this product to a clean, towel dried beard (I normally use beard oil in this manner). The problem is that this product contains no natural oils, only a bunch of unnecessary chemicals. The only up side is that it also contains Reuzel's T-4 Tonic Blend which is beneficial. But your beard needs more than just that. It needs natural oils and conditioners, not all the chemicals.  I prefer the results I get with all natural products.  My beard is softer, healthier and more manageable when using my regular products.\n\nMy regular routine consists of a quality beard oil right out of the shower, massaging it into the skin and brushing it through the hair with a boar bristle brush. I let the oil absorb while I tend to other things.  A few minutes later I apply a beard balm that contains Shea Butter, Mango Seed Butter, Lanolin, Apricot Kernel Oil, Jojoba Seed Oil, Beeswax, and Cocoa Seed Butter. Then at the end I apply a little beard wax to provide the hold. This gives me a soft, healthy, manageable beard without any chemicals and no long term hair damage. The results of my routine are far superior to the Reuzel Beard Foam & Beard Balm combo.\n\nOkay, the scent...  I know full well that smells are subjective, but... this Beard Foam STINKS!!  At first it smells like soap, --so far so good-- BUT then it goes through a bad breath stage, which progresses into to a plastic/rubbery smell, then it finally settles into a powdery scent, similar to the Beard Balm.  This powdery scent then lingers on, and on, and on, and on...  I personally HATE  powdery smells, so if you're like me avoid the Beard Foam (and the Beard Balm, it's even worse).  However, if you're one of those weirdos that actually wants to smell like a big 'ol powder puff, well... you're going to love it.\n\nSpeaking to the 'deodorizing' properties, I suppose if you just finished eating your girlfriend's second-hand tuna sandwich the Beard Foam may provide a slight improvement to your beard's smell.

Gold, pink, and beige tones all blended in one.  I don't like full coverage foundations, so I thought this might be fun.  In reality, the cream blended in very sheer with lots of sparkle.  It did not perfect anything.  My skin looked exactly the same but with mild sparkles all over.  The pink all blended sheer.  (FYI, in case it helps the reader,  I am a light medium complexion, not fair, but not olive or yellow, I tan easily and when not tanned I normally wear a pinky color type blush).\n\nSince this  blended sheer and looked like I had put nothing on my skin other than a bit of sparkle, I decided to layer it on a few times on my cheeks to see if it would work as a natural looking blush.  It did blush my cheeks, but then it also turned up the sparkle too much for my liking.\n\nLooking at the ingredients, it starts with a few silicones at the top of the list.  So I would consider this to be a simple silicone primer.  Any color or skin perfecting you desire you will still have to accomplish via other methods, ex:  foundation of choice or mineral makeup of choice.\n\nI think I will have to save this for special events, or date nights.  This product could maybe add a nice touch for night-time makeup.  ( the sparkly touch might look nice in low lighting (restaurants, etc) or in pictures (as in: the pigments and sparkles will reflect the camera light and \"hide\" imperfections as far as the picture goes, but not in person).

This band will probably shift when working on the unit, so you'll just want to make sure you get it or back in place before reassembly. Now you will need to cut the zip tie that holds the batteries in place(This won't come out until the batteries are removed). You can gently pry the metal clips off the batteries with needle nose pliers. This can take some time. If you rush and do not do it slow and gentle you will most likely break the metal clips. If the clips break, you will most likely need to solder replacement wires to the main board, as they will probably not be long enough to reach the batteries. I used a small piece of copper wire to solder the bottom of the new batteries (- to +). Don't use a thick wire on the bottom of the batteries, it is unnecessary and could  take up too much space, causing the batteries to not fit properly in the brush. Place the new batteries into position in the brush. You should be able to reuse the plastic wrap from the original batteries to the help keep them together. However, you can use some electrical tape as an alternative. Electrical tape can make a snug fit in the battery holder, which should hold them in place so you don't need to use new zip ties; I chose to put in new zip ties. Now, solder the positive & negative wires to the tops of the new batteries. Once done, put everything back together. You may want to add additional sealant to make sure it stays water tight. I added a small silicon layer to the top edge of the lower plastic casing. When putting back together the metal ring should meet this. Silicon will squeeze out. Wipe off any excess. Now put the screw and rubber cap back. You now have a working brush again."}, "predictions": [{"result": [{"value": {"choices": ["Positive"]}, "id": "data-29860", "from_name": "sentiment", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices"}]}]}, {"data": {"text": "Love the scent, not to sure that I would call it a great option for exfoliating your skin."}, "predictions": [{"result": [{"value": {"choices": ["Positive"]}, "id": "data-57616", "from_name": "sentiment", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices"}]}]}, {"data": {"text": "Love the scent, not to sure that I would call it a great option for exfoliating your skin."}, "predictions": [{"result": [{"value": {"choices": ["Positive"]}, "id": "data-58198", "from_name": "sentiment", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices"}]}]}, {"data": {"text": "These gloves are thick and soft and nice to wear.

That lightness makes it easy to smooth on the face.  The downside to that: it's so light that it doesn't impart much moisture at all.  This would be great for someone who doesn't have particularly dry skin, but for those of us who need a big dose of moisture, this doesn't work for that.  For those who benefit from light moisturization, be prepared for how this product gives you that: in my experience, after it's smoothed on, it leaves a lightly tacky, even greasy feel to the skin.\n\nThe scent has gotten a lot of mentions in reviews, and there is a reason for that.  I thought it would be fine for me even though I'm very sensitive to strong aromas because \"parfum/fragrance\" is the last item on the ingredient list.  Initially, it seems to have a lovely, light rose scent.  However, that scent doesn't dissipate at all - it just sits there on your face, and for me, it became cloying and eventually overwhelming.  By the time I'd had it on for about a half hour, I'd begun to develop a headache and had to wash it off.  (Side note: it didn't come off easily at all with just water; this is the kind of product that requires some kind of cleanser to totally remove.)\n\nThe packaging is nice, in terms of the inside of the box having diagrams and instructions for application of the product, and the jar is quite pretty with a useful mirror serving as the top of the lid.  The downside here, though, is that this obviously requires you to dip your fingers into the product in order to then apply it to your face; as such, even with clean hands, eventually bacteria could start to be a concern, so I would have preferred if the cream had come in a pump-form.\n\nThe aspects of the product that don't have \"cons\" - it's paraben free, and even though my skin is highly sensitive, I didn't experience any irritation when I put this on my face.  (However, it is worth noting again that I could only tolerate having it on my skin for a half hour because of the fragrance.)\n\nIt's been so difficult - actually it's been impossible, thus far - for me to find a moisturizer/cream that won't irritate my sensitive skin and won't make my extreme sensitivity to fragrance come into play.  This product will likely work for people who don't have to deal with those things and don't require a product that delivers a lot of moisture.

First disappointment was that I must have selected the one Oribe product that smells like, well, wax.  No beautiful scents, supposedly originating from the same lab that Tom Ford concocted his amazing perfumes, for this product.  Additionally, I found the wax difficult to work with (i.e., really challenging to get it out of the container and spread throughout my palms without chunks of it falling on the floor).  Finally, I hated that it made my hair hard and crunchy once applied.  It held it alright, but I don't care for spiky hair.  I realize many people like a product that does this for them.  What can I say? This product would work for you.  And although it had maximum hold, I needed to wash my hair and restyle every day in order to have the product hold the same way it did upon first application.  I have really short hair and can go three days without washing and still have my hair look, smell and feel good.  I don't want to wash my hair every day and reapply product in order to style my hair the right way.  I will say that I liked that the product was \"formulated without sodium chloride\" and is \"color and keratin treatment safe.\"  Additional plus, it states that it has \"UV protection for hair.\"  Can tell that it is a quality product, it just didn't provide the two big factors, heavenly scent and medium (not stiff) hold, for which, I was willing to pay $30 for 1.7 oz.(!)

I am not sure why it seems so much stronger that when I've used it in the past - it could be that I applied more than I usually do, or because i applied and put jeans on vs a skirt or loose, lightweight, summer pants during past applications. Whatever the case, it's giving me a headache and is quite strong. I'm not removing a star because the product still works well, and is really no different from other products in having the tell tale self-tanning cream odor.\n\nOriginal post:\n This is the second product by this brand that I've tried thru Vine. The first was&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Vita-Liberata-Phenomenal-2-3-Week-Tinted-Tan-Mousse-Medium-4-22-fl-oz/dp/B00865610O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Vita Liberata Phenomenal 2-3 Week Tinted Tan Mousse, Medium, 4.22 fl. oz.</a>&nbsp;This is almost as good. The Mousse had no scent; this has a mild scent but I'm not sure what it is. It is very faint and doesn't smell anything like the typical self-tanning products (from drug store version to high end version, they all have a tell tale scent.)  After an hour or so, the scent seemed a bit stronger, but was still mild compared with the typical self tanner scent and certainly wasn't enough to make me self conscious.\n\nI tested on my forearms and hands, and after about 3-4 hours, my skin had a nice, fresh glow. The product itself is white, a mix between a rich, thick cream and a lotion that easily blends into the skin. It dries fairly quickly; the first application I used a bit too much on my right arm and it took longer to dry fully to the touch (around 30 min.) I was more careful with my left arm and used half the amount - about 1.5 dime size of product on the second arm. It blends easily, but no matter what product I use or how careful I am, I always have at least a few streaks. The streaks this time were on my fingers, which is always a hard area to cover to ensure you get the backs but not fronts of the fingers.\n\nThe second application helped to easily cover up my streaks.

I bought this curling iron for my wife, after reading online reviews.  She LOVED this curling iron.  She liked that it heated up fast, opened and closed well, gripped her hair when she wanted it to, and let go when it was supposed to.\n\nI couldn't say exactly when it went from \"love\" to less than that.  But it started probably around the two year mark, after being used on average, about once per week.  It started to not heat up really well, and I think that there had been a flaw of some kind in the power cord, at the point where the cord attaches to the swivel connection on the iron.  There was no visible problem, anywhere on the cord.  It eventually got to the point where it didn't heat at all.  That was probably in this last year, so it was a good 2-3 years old, I would say.\n\nSo this last winter, about 2/2014, I took the thing apart, and couldn't find a thing wrong.  I put it back together and kind of told my wife that it was her imagination--I don't know, I think I was just too busy at the time to be bothered.  Then when I saw her a few weeks later using another old curling iron, and I asked her why she wasn't using the her favorite, and she said it just doesn't work anymore.  So I figured maybe she wasn't making it up :)\n\nI took it apart again, and put an ohm meter on the cord part, and it was not good.  I figured it unlikely that it was in the actual cord.  So I started to cut into the thick part of the cord where it had a reinforced curve in it, and was able to get down to where I found that there must have been a break there.  I cut that part of the cord out, soldered the cord onto the connectors that had been inside that molded reinforced curve, and put all of it back together with epoxy as something of a new homemade connection to reinforce it, and she was off and running again.\n\nThen in just the last few months, probably when the curling iron was about 3 1/2 years old, my wife started complaining that the curling iron was not gripping her hair well enough, and was slipping, and also that it was making a squeaking sound whenever she opened and closed the pincers--don't know if that's the right term.  I am also not sure I understand another comment that she made, though, that she has trouble getting her hair out of it when she finds it is slipping.\n\nAnyway, all of that doesn't matter.  I just looked at the spring area and could see that up underneath where the spring is, the point that contacts the pincer just below the thumb knob, there is a tiny roller that helps the spring to slide quietly back and forth, that was off center, and it also wasn't rolling anymore.  It was mostly sliding.  So I adjusted it to the side a little, and liberally sprayed some dry lubricant on it.  The action works better, and it doesn't make any noise, so we will have to wait until she uses it again to see if it works.\n\nSo as of today 6/16/2014, the iron is still going after approximately 200+ uses, albeit with some required tweaking to keep it out of the garbage.  I would like to believe that the power cord issue that we had was a rare defect, and that most people never run into that.  I'm thinking that most people could use this iron over 200 times and probably just be starting to have a squeaky spring issue, and that's about it.  If I were to have to start this product search again, I would definitely take a chance again on this iron, and hope that we didn't get the cord defect in that reinforced bend near the swivel.\n\nFor the money, and the use that we've had with this, I think it's a great deal.  I actually just realized that we probably have used it many more than 200 times, as we have four girls aged 12 and under as well, but they generally don't get their hair curled, although on some special occasions, several of them do.\n\nDetails on my star rating:\nWhy did I ding this by one star?  Well, although I would buy it again in a second, Amazon's star system equates four stars with a \"like it\" and five stars as a \"love it.\"  I could imagine some engineering tweaks to their design that would eliminate the issues we had.  Also, I saw the inside of it when I was working on it, and although the parts were adequate, I would be cheating a curling iron with better quality parts that deserved the five stars, if I were to give this one five.\n\nAs I've said in other reviews that I've written, to me, either four or five stars is a \"buy with confidence\" in my book.  I wouldn't buy anything again with 1-2 stars on my scale, and a middle-of-the-road three star review by me would be \"your mileage may vary\" and would be a 50/50 shot."}, "predictions": [{"result": [{"value": {"choices": ["Negative"]}, "id": "data-49460", "from_name": "sentiment", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices"}]}]}, {"data": {"text": "Purchased 6/2010, reviewed 6/2014:\n\nWell, better late than never.

I normally purchase it in person from the salon I visit regularly.  My hair is always silky smooth and great smelling and therefore I have no qualms about paying the money I do for it 'cause frankly I think it's worth it.  About a month ago I ran out of my beloved Drench right before going on vacation.  Short on time to make the drive to my salon to purchase another bottle, I jumped on Amazon.com to take advantage of my prime membership perks (free 2 day shipping) and a slightly lower price.  I was estatic when I received my bottle of Drench but after using it for some time I noticed my hair felt dry, brittle and had a weird chemical smell equivalent to the smell of gasoline.  My hair became unmanagable, dull and lifeless.  It felt thick with buildup.  Not healthy and not shiny (what I'm used to with Drench).  Needless to say, I became very suspicious of the product I purchased online.  Even my scalp suffered horribly and become very tender and red.  I experienced a tingly, burning sensation after every use.  Well, last night I decided I had enough of this bottle and went into the salon to purchase my shampoo in person.  After washing my hair with this new bottle of Drench, my hair is back to smelling great, feeling silky smooth, looking shiny and feeling healthy.  I am 100% positive it was the shampoo I purchased online.  Just a word to the wise, if you read the guarantee on the bottle, it says it's only guaranteed when purchased from a licensed salon.  I am very skeptical that the product I bought here online is even legit.  After comparing the two bottles, I finally noticed the difference.  The bottle I purchased from the salon has a lot number/product number on the bottom of the bottle and the one I bought from Amazon does not.  Just be careful folks, I feel like I was sold a fake bottle of Sebastian Drench.

I left cream #1 on about 20 min after I completed the application (try to apply it very quckly starting with the area of your hair that is most course/curly, for me that was the back of my head). DO not put it on the ends of your hair until you are at that last 5 min of process time!!!!\n This product tells you to blow dry your hair and then straighten it before applying cream #2, now I hate using a blow dryer so I let it haor dry for a while before I used the blow dryer and I don't feel like it affect the quality of my results. I blow dried the rest when it was about 75% dry and then straightened it. You don't need the boi Ionic straightener for this but I do recommend using a good straightener. I have the CHI and it worked very well.\nCream #2 is the same but I let it process for about 7 min after I complete the application. After I washed it out I made sure I did not use any shampoo and I did not straigten it afterwards. I let it air dry so I could get an accurate idea of how well it worked, and I was pleasantly surpirsed. my hair was straight, it had some minor waves but it was mor managable. I put a litle more of the iprotect oil in as it was drying as it wasa little dry and frizzy but I blame that on the excessive amout of washing and chemicals applied to it. I also threw in some high quality Argan oil to add moisture back in, I will need to re-dye my hair in a few days since its kind of orange now but all in all its pretty good stuff. plus I did not need to use all of the product so I have enough to retouch it at least twice!"}, "predictions": [{"result": [{"value": {"choices": ["Negative"]}, "id": "data-78009", "from_name": "sentiment", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices"}]}]}, {"data": {"text": "My daughter received a sample of this in her Birchbox and I immediately loved it and had to order one.

I should admit that I have a thick, coarse, fast-growing beard, and what I review here may not be applicable for men with beards that are not as thick, coarse, or fast-growing. Upon reading the reviews of the open-comb, #25C being a more aggressive razor due to the open comb, I decided to give it a try.\n\nI've tried every type of shaving in the 40+ years that I've been shaving, including wet shaving with disposable razors, multiple-blade cartridge razors, double-edged safety razors, shavettes, and straight razors; and I've tried a number of different electric razors. No method of shaving comes close to shaving with a straight razor, which I did for years, but I tired of the constant maintenance (stropping 50 to 60 times each morning, occasional honing, and annual sharpening by a professional service), and the cost. Insofar as the multiple-blade cartridge razors, the cost is prohibitive, and the supposed benefits of multiple blades is a gimmick, at least as far as my experience with them. Disposable razors are hit-and-miss in terms of quality. Even using a good quality double-edged razor, I still need to do a final touch-up with a shavette, unless I want 5 o'clock shadow by noon.\n\nSo, I thought that the 25C would provide a closer shave than the 33C, as posted by many reviewers.\n\nIt doesn't.\n\nI could detect no discernable difference between the 25C and the 33C. Upon close inspection of the design, I am convinced that it is because the base plate on the 25C holds the blade much closer to the comb that does the base plate on the 33C. On the closed-comb 33C, there is about 1mm of space between the blade and the comb, which allows for more direct contact with the skin by the blade, depending upon the angle at which one holds the razor. On the open-comb 25C, the blade is almost in direct contact with the combs, with no perceptible space between them. Consequently, it is not possible to get the same full contact with the skin as it is with the 33C.\n\nI did change the blades that I've been using, switching to the Feather Hi-stainless blades, which appear to be much sharper than the Astra blades or the Personna blades that I had been using. Still, even with the Feather blades, the shave is not close enough, and I have to do a final pass against the grain with a straight-razor or a shavette. The feather blades last for about 3 shaves before I have to replace them.\n\nBoth the 25C and the 33C are fine DE razors, and I would buy them again. However, I will be more cautious in reading reviews of razors claiming to be \"more aggressive.\""}, "predictions": [{"result": [{"value": {"choices": ["Negative"]}, "id": "data-20303", "from_name": "sentiment", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices"}]}]}, {"data": {"text": "I bought this cream because I used to love (and recommend) the vitamin barrier ointment.

Very easy to work up in your palm or with face lathering. The lather itself is thick, rich, and luxurious. In the tub the texture is more on the moist side than a cella. Exceptionally creamy. But my problem is the scent.\n\nSandalwood scents are one of my favorites. I like sandalwoods that are fused with citrus, or maybe other frangrant oils or essential oils to create a complex sensual experience. But this scent is a one shot pony: it smells like natural sandalwood. Nothing complex or tantalizing. Nothing to linger and tease the senses about what it is. The smell completely falls flat: it's wood! I have a sandalwood chess set, and that's what this smell like. My mother-in-law has a block of sandalwood that she uses for her prayers, and that is EXACTLY what this smell is like. To say the smell is \"boring\" would give it too much credence. It also has a weird after scent.\n\nI can't place my finger on it, but it is like an overly waxy kind of smell. Not a fragrance. Just waxy Sandalwood. If I smelled this long it would give me a headache. But I did give it three stars because the lather was pretty sick!\n\nIf you want something to compare with AOS Sandalwood, try Trumpers Sandalwood soap. This is a triplemilled hard, so you would be comparing a cream to a soap. However, the soap has a distinct citrus smell harmonized with soft scents of Sandalwwd. One of my absolute favorite Sandalwood scents, and and another awesome lather producer. You could also try the Trumpers Sandalwood cream, which has a softer version of the sandalwood scent than the Trumper's bar, but still MUCH MUCH better than the AOS Sandalwood. ((BTW, if you are looking for a top AOS cream, I highly recomend the Ocean Kelp--See my review)  Evelyn & Crabtee also has a sandalwood, but its more of a floral scent. Pleasant, but not terribly manly. Then there is the Italian Cella\n\nSo I don't really see this Sandalwood by AOS sustaining a big part market share of \"Sandalwood soaps\" without some type of reformulation. Oh sure, they have the big name, but the really need to work on those scents. The smell is quite pedestrian, like something you would find from a vendor in the hallways at the mall, or maybe selling some cheap incense.  If you like Sandalwood, go with Trumpers Bars; notes of citrus, great moisturing, tightens skin, and smells awesome!!!!

I started doing very gentle highlighting (hair painted on with different colors of blonde) on my light brown hair and it look amazing!  After about a year of coloring...(ie every 4 months the highlights were touched up and a haircut) this small amount of coloring and the onset of winter left my hair breaking and lots of knotted ends. It had only been 3 weeks since my last haircut/haircolor. The only heat treatment I ever used was gentle drying on my bangs to blow them out, but it didn't take much to damage my hair.  I tried a wash-in keratin treatment (Aphogee), I tried deep conditioning treatments (one was Aussie...but I tried many others).  None smoothed out my hair more than a day or so...and the dried ends just returned.  I then did a glaze treamtent (Sebastian cellophane Clear), which smoothed things out and helped seal the cuticle for the time being.  The next week, however, I got flustered with the damage.....and my wedding is later this year...so the damage really scared me.  I binged on a couple seasons of a Netflix show and I cut off just the tips of a lot of my ends myself (which is usually ok), however, I did it so much until my layers were gone...so I messaged my stylist...apologized for being crazy and taking shears to my head, and he fit me in to fix the damage. We wanted to keep the length to prepare for my wedding, so again, he just trimmed the ends up, however the hair itself was still dry. He recommended the Oribe Hair Masque for me to use once a week, and said if it wasn't a strong enough conditioner for my hair the company would buy back the remainder of the container from him and I could exchange for a stronger conditioner.  I used this one time and my hair was beautiful. I washed with clarifying shampoo (Kendra) and then my coloring shampoo (redken) and then towel dried,applied the masque for 5 minutes, and washed out.  I applied just a small amount of head after washing out just to seal in any remaining conditioner...it has been 4 days and my hair is still amazing.  Awesome product.

I still have some of the original eye cream, it was just easier to use the intensive recovery all over.  When that was all used, I continued to use only the sun screen. Spots have not returned.  However, I am getting ready to order more of the strengthener for the winter since I don't really need the sunscreen everyday.  If I had unlimited income I would still be using the cleansing line, and may again.  Love the smell and feel of my skin - even before lotion.  However, Cetaphil still gives me non-drying non-irritating cleansing that it has for 30 years and it's alot more economical, beside I always use some type of lotion after cleansing.  The strengthener is 5% pro-niacin and lighter than the intensive or eye cream. I tried putting my daily facial sunscreen over the strengthener but too much lotion.  That is why I added the sunscreen when daily sunscreen became necessary in March.  The sunscreen is only 2.5% pro-niacin but priced accordingly.  It was better than eliminating the pro-niacin or sunscreen.  I also tried the decolletage lotion at 2.5% pro-niacin for spots on chest and hands but did not see results.

The effects seem to be long lasting, not to say that if you stop using for a week or so your eyes won't go back to having fine lines, but thats with any of the best products/procedures on the market, they require maintenance....I gave the product 4 stars because of the time factor.

My hair was thinning in the front and receding like the letter M a common pattern found in men as they age. At first, I thought the HairMax Laser Comb was a scam. I am a skeptic by nature, but I was desperate and after watching the Today show review of this product I believed it was worth a try. You can see the Today show review on YT. The only thing I noticed within the first two weeks of use was that my hair seemed to be more soft, but nothing else. Then after a few months I saw a small difference. The hair that was thinning started to thicken and where it was receding I saw a limited amount of growth. More time passed and I was not sure if any results came about. It was a slow progression. Recently, I was looking for a specific picture on my PC unrelated to myself and I opened a photo of me that was 2-3 years old. WOW I was amazed how much of my hair had receded back then and now it looks significantly better. I can't over emphasis how much better my hair looks now. I remember BACK THEN I COULD NOT GROW OUT MY HAIR OUT LONG IN THE FRONT. The best way I can describe it is that where my hair was thinning it was like the hair pores were choking off the hair follicle or they were closing slowly causing my hair there to become frail and thin and barely grow. The rest of my hair is and has always been thick and coarse so this was surprising to see the difference in texture and the lack of growth. Now I have my hair long especially the front. I wear my hair in a Pompadour style. I can't imagine this works for everyone, but what does. I want to reiterate if your looking for fast or instant results this will most likely not work. I believe this is why so many others have stated this does not work.\n\nIt took me EIGHT months for me to notice a significant change, BUT now no one notices I have any issues with my hair and I do not look like I inherited my fathers hair line. I AM SO GLAD I LIVED IN THE TIME WHEN THIS WAS INVENTED!!!! Sure it's expensive, but what is your hairline worth? That's all I had to ask myself. It's in my nature to overbuy. I have done it many times in my life. On my first need to travel I decided to take and use only my home version and decided to keep my second comb as a backup. However, I think this is over done.

If any aspect of my review changes or issues arise, I will edit more review to reflect the additional information.\n\nEDIT: I hadn't used this straightener in a few weeks and, when I attempted to turn it on, it no longer worked. Will be throwing out and getting something different.\n\nFirst, and perhaps not so important, this straighter does have a sleek look. It's lightweight and narrow, unlike some of the bulky straighteners I've owned in the past. This is a plus as it takes up less counter space and isn't an eyesore.\n\nThere is one button that controls on/off and the temperature of the device. Holding down the button turns it on/off, while double clicking allows for temperature control. Above the button there is a series of lights that change depending on the temperature and indicate that the straighter is heating vs ready to use. While, as far as I can tell, this type of control set-up does work, the different temperatures are not noted on the device. I use the same temp every time, so this doesn't affect me as much, but, if you might need to adjust the heat, you'll have to check the instructions pamphlet for temp ranges.\n\nI have admittedly thin hair, but it is naturally curly. I had no problem straightening the majority with only one pass, but some of the more finicky bits, like my bedhead bangs, took a bit more finesse.\n\nAs a plus, this straightener did come with two hair clips to divide and twist up hair when straightening.

My roommate has it for 5 years now and it is working in top-notch condition as the day she received it.\n\nThe one I received DID not do any of the above. It straightens but it is comparable to a cheap straightener from a drug store. My hair is left somewhat straight and rough. The straightener is VERY light and feels all plastic! (Granted, Babyliss straighteners are light but it doesn't feel cheap) The power cord is also loose (i.e, in the future it is very likely to not transmit not enough power to the straightener)\n\nAnyway, I am not gonna leave the seller's name bc Idk if they know of it or not...so please, inspect yours upon arrival.

Years ago I had professional laser hair removal years ago that didn't work and thankfully got my 4K back! Two years ago I bought an IPL home laser that also didn't work but at times I felt it was helping ingrown and rashes so I stuck with it. After the first few treatments I could definitely tell this would be different.\n\nI spent a lot of time debating between this machine and the MeMyElos, same technology, $50 price difference. I was so sure this model said it came with more pulses and did the math and went with this model. I was extremely bewildered and annoyed when it arrived but was excited to try it and figured I had a braintarded moment. I thought I had read every single review and question but only after I received it did I notice that someone else specifically asked about the number of flashes. I'm still wondering why I was so sure it had more flashes and why I'm not the only one! Wish I had taken a screenshot when I placed the order.\n\nSo I would say it's definitely working a little bit but after seven treatments I'm still only at about 25% reduction in bikini area but less than that everywhere else. I'm using it on full legs, bikini, armpits, face and forearms. I haven't tried waxing before using it because waxing gives me crazy ingrowns and because I still have darker hairs that shouldn't be waxed! On my face I do tweeze coarser hairs.\n\nI'm 5' tall (size 4-6 so super petite) and the bulb died after about 5-6 treatments. Maybe if you're only treating smaller areas the bulb will last but when you spend this much money on the laser of course you want to use it everywhere! I thought about returning it but I'm so desperate to stop the ingrown hairs so I ordered another bulb.\n\nHopefully I'll update this after more treatments with some better results. More importantly, I hope that the new bulb lasts long enough to find out.\n\nPS... I think the estimated times shown to treat an area are based on having the laser at the lowest setting, where the flashes are quicker, and if you're only passing over 2x."}, "predictions": [{"result": [{"value": {"choices": ["Positive"]}, "id": "data-30209", "from_name": "sentiment", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices"}]}]}, {"data": {"text": "Makes my hair heavy and somewhat oily"}, "predictions": [{"result": [{"value": {"choices": ["Positive"]}, "id": "data-46935", "from_name": "sentiment", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices"}]}]}, {"data": {"text": "Like it... but very expensive for a foam mitt"}, "predictions": [{"result": [{"value": {"choices": ["Positive"]}, "id": "data-49451", "from_name": "sentiment", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices"}]}]}, {"data": {"text": "I thought it wasn't working, then suddenly the good product struck me with advantages."}, "predictions": [{"result": [{"value": {"choices": ["Negative"]}, "id": "data-44699", "from_name": "sentiment", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices"}]}]}, {"data": {"text": "Writes review earlier"}, "predictions": [{"result": [{"value": {"choices": ["Negative"]}, "id": "data-67873", "from_name": "sentiment", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices"}]}]}, {"data": {"text": "It's not the real deal..but for the price..its ok I guess."}, "predictions": [{"result": [{"value": {"choices": ["Positive"]}, "id": "data-72464", "from_name": "sentiment", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices"}]}]}, {"data": {"text": "met my expectations"}, "predictions": [{"result": [{"value": {"choices": ["Negative"]}, "id": "data-68079", "from_name": "sentiment", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices"}]}]}, {"data": {"text": "I've had a clarisonic for almost a decade.

After the very first use I saw a reduction in the amount of hair that returned on my arms and legs. It actually performed better than I had dared to hope for on that 1st treatment of m arms and legs.  I have a few hairs on my face that I had hoped it would get rid of, but after 4 treatments I can't tell any difference in my facial hair, but it is already sparse and fairly fine.  The hair coming back on my arms and legs is more sparse and doesn't come back very quickly.  A week after treatment I had to look carefully at my legs to see if I thought I needed to shave.  I decided that I did, but it was not as thick and only as long as it usually is after about 2 or 3 days.  I do have fair skin and medium brown hair so it is a good combination for optimal results I guess.  I haven't seen any real noticeable improvements with the subsequent treatments (2-4), but after a treatment it looks pretty good for a week afterward, so it remains slower coming back than shaving.  I am happy with my purchase so far.\nI am disappointed with t he life of the lamp cartridges.  It advertised that there were 7000-10,000 flashes per cartridge.  By my estimation there are probably between 2000-3000 flashes.  I figured this after counting the number of flashes in a few sample areas and multiplying those by the numbers of areas that  were similar.  It should be a fairly accurate estimate. I was able to treat my face armpits, top of my forearms and legs all once and my face armpits and one forearm on the 2nd treatment with a cartridge.  When one cartridge \"burned out\" after just that much use I began the 2nd cartridge and counted flashes in sample areas, to see if maybe it really was using 7000-10,000 flashes to cover by body, but it really wasn't and the 2nd cartridge \"burned out\" before I finished a 3rd treatment.  Luckily I had ordered a replacement after the 1st one burned out and it was here to finished my 3rd treatment and do a 4th treatment.  Anyway it wasn't just one \"poor\" cartridge.  It appears that they really only do have about 1/3 of the advertised life.

It's one of the things I admire and pride myself about my body. One day during finals week (I'm guessing excessive stress made this happen) but I got a pimple. It hurt so bad and was huge. When I do (rarely) get a pimple, you can barely see them because I treat them before and during its early emergence on my face. Somehow, I came across (Please don't publicly shame me when I say this) an Instagram post on Yahoo of a Kylie Jenner snapchat of how she treats her face for acne. Due to that snapchat and my desperation, I forked over $16 on this drying lotion. Why did I do that? This stuff just chemically burns the crap out of my face, left the area peeling, and left behind a dark case of hyper-pigmentation. My skin isn't even that sensitive. Never again will I buy something like this to put on my face. I'll stick to the basics that have always worked for me.\n\nHere's what works for me if you're curious: I get almost all of this stuff on amazon\n-A gentle cleanser (cetaphil or neutrogena)\n-Oil cleansing every now and then (olive oil and castor oil with a few drops of Trader Joe's tea tree oil are my faves)\n-ACV mixed with water as a toner or Burt's Bees tomato toner\n-Tea tree oil and clean and clear's persa-gel ( to treat bumps and pimples )\n**I've learned that if you really want to have nice skin, you have to protect it and keep it moisturized. Also keep your routine SIMPLE**\n-Olay Total effects 7 in one SPF 30 or Olay Complete for Combination/Oily skin SPF 15 in the am (depends on the season)\n-Olay Regenerist Night Cream in the pm or SR Luna Oil with SR Good Genes serum\n\n(The only non-drug store things I use on my face are Sunday Riley's Luna Oil and Good Genes serum. They're pretty darn good!!! The Luna Oil also has certain antiseptic properties that help prevent acne! Crazy right?! It also makes my skin so soft! The serum is good for hyper-pigmentation and brightening skin. Both of them do many other things too! Sephora has a duo kit for $78. It was a birthday gift to myself! I work on campus! Don't judge! As a college student, I often times don't get as much sleep that I'm suppose to and I was afraid that it would start showing in my face even though the saying is \"Black don't crack\". I got this duo to help prevent premature aging. #wrinkles #bags #Crowsfeet #SayNoToFillers #SayNoToBotox #AgeGraciously)\n\n***Side Note: I use to have really bad oily skin. In early high school, I would dry it out with acne astringents and skip out on moisturizer at night because I didn't want my face to be really oily. Eventually, I realized that my face was overproducing oils because of this behavior. The moment I started using gentle cleansers, oils, and moisturizers, the moment my skin realized it didn't need to drown itself in sebum. As I go through my day, I still do produce oil on my skin but it's not excessive. It's just a healthy amount to protect my face from the harsh environment and create a healthy glow. During the warmer months, I walk around with a pack of oil blotting sheets just in case.\n\nI hope this helped someone! I know it was a lot to read. Also, use smile.amazon.com to make your purchases!

The Jack Black face scrub is painful.\n\nAnyway, even though I have not run out of my current supply of Beard Lube, I ordered this Shave Cream.  I used it for the first time about 30 minutes ago.  This stuff is REMARKABLE!  It takes a bit more effort to apply than Beard Lube (I do not own $200 shaving brushes) but I worked up a good lather with just my fingers.

My hair was bleached pretty unevenly (I went to a bad salon for the first round of bleach, and they left my roots completely untouched; for this reason, when I did the other rounds of bleach, my roots remained one shade darker), so I noticed that it ONLY affected the lightest portion of my hair, which went from light blonde to platinum/silver blonde. The roots, which are more golden, were not affected at all, or at least insignificantly enough that I didn't notice any difference.\nAttached are photos of my hair directly before and after washing with Sexy Hair Bright Blonde Shampoo (after photos show both wet and dry) and photos of the shampoo itself, compared to TIGI's Dumb Blonde Shampoo. All photos (besides the one with wet hair) are taken under identical indoor lighting, with the same background for similar white balance.\n\nSHAMPOO COLOR:\nIt is said that the darker a purple shampoo is, the more effective it should be. This shampoo is a very dark blue-purple, very similar in shade to TIGI's Dumb Blonde shampoo - maybe a tad darker - but without shimmer.\n\nSCENT: 5/5\nThe scent is very pleasant. It is a very nice honey/chamomile scent, but it is not too strong, and it fades so you don't notice it throughout the day.\nIn comparison, TIGI's Dumb Blonde shampoo is completely inoffensive/unnoticeable; Davines Alchemic Silver Conditioner has a scent that is not chemical, but the smell (also not my favorite) is VERY strong and lasts days after washing your hair with it (which I find annoying).\n\nPACKAGING: 2/5\nThe packaging is not my favorite. I much prefer the pump of the TIGI Dumb Blonde shampoo, since I can quickly use one hand to pump out more shampoo as needed, rather than having to use both hands to pick up the bottle, click it open, and turn it over to squeeze the shampoo out."}, "predictions": [{"result": [{"value": {"choices": ["Negative"]}, "id": "data-25857", "from_name": "sentiment", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices"}]}]}, {"data": {"text": "Very feminine scent"}, "predictions": [{"result": [{"value": {"choices": ["Positive"]}, "id": "data-28022", "from_name": "sentiment", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices"}]}]}, {"data": {"text": "I had the previous packaged bottle.\n\nThe new package smell less strong than the previous one, which is good.\nGood moisture and doesn't take long for the skin to absorb."}, "predictions": [{"result": [{"value": {"choices": ["Negative"]}, "id": "data-43678", "from_name": "sentiment", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices"}]}]}, {"data": {"text": "It works.

The girl had a couple coupons that brought the price down and made me feel slightly better about spending the money on it.\n\nI've had problems with breakouts for the past 10-12 yrs and have tried countless different face washes without success until the Clinique. Then that stopped working. This latest breakout was along my jawline.  I have a problem with oily skin all month long but its especially bad during my cycle. I've been using the Mia 2 for a little over 2 weeks now and initially I had little extra breakout spots, which I expected as the extra junk rose to the surface. Nothing big.  The breakouts along my jawline, I THINK, are finally starting to heal. Is it clearing up because of the Mia 2 or the cleanser?  Don't know that.  I can tell that the pores on my nose and chin are smaller and I'm sure that's because of the Mia 2.  Happy about that.  We'll see what happens with my next cycle.\n\nI also used this on my 9 yr old who has a problem with white heads on her nose and blackheads on her chin.  After only a few uses, we could already see a difference in her skin.  So for that, we both feel it's worth it.\n\nWhat I don't like about the Mia 2:\nI don't like the timed shut off.  I don't like that I only get one minute to wash my face and I don't see the point in the little beep that tells me to switch to a different spot on my face.  I get that it's so I can get the most out of that one minute but if it didn't have that one minute time in the first place they wouldn't need the stupid  beep.  Most days, I feel I need more than a minute so I'm hitting the button to use up two one minute cycles.  What if I'm having a particularly bad day and feel I need to wash extra or have an extra large face?  Or, in my case, I need to wash my jaw line and part of my neck so that's not included in the spots they tell you to wash for a certain amount of time and therefore I run out of time when washing my face and the thing shuts off on me.  Frustrating.\n\nThe second speed is pointless.  I honestly cannot tell any difference between the first and the second speed but I still hit the button twice. I guess it's psychological. It must be going faster if I'm hitting the button twice, right?!\n\nThe battery life totally SUCKS!  The instructions say that you should charge it for 24 hrs before the initial use.  Like most battery opperated items you buy, that's normal.  So then I read that I can expect 24 minutes of use out of a full charge.  Serious?!  That's it?!  So if I'm using two one minute charges morning and night (not including if I use it on my daughter), that's only going to give me 6 days of use!  What a crock!  To top that off is the charging time.  It's almost as bad as the initial charge.  I went to use it one night and it was dead.  So, I popped it on the charger before I went to bed, not knowing how long it would take to charge, I figured it would be ready for me to use the next morning.  Nope, it was still charging when I got up! Came home from work and it was STILL charging!  Pulled out my instruction manual to see what it said about charge time and I read that it takes 18 HOURS for additional charges!  Again...SERIOUS?!  Isn't there a rapid charger or something?!  Depending on when I put it on the charger, that's like 2-3 face washings I have to miss for a charging.  I just have a hard time believing that for the amount of money this thing costs they wouldn't put better battery in this thing or give you a better charger!\n\nSo those are my thougts on it.  I'm fairly satisfied with the results and won't be returning it but had I known ahead of time the things I know now, I don't know if I would have spent the money on it.  I'm certainly not rich and struggled with the decision to buy it because of the cost.  I will update again in a month or so to let you know how things are going.\n\nUpdate 12/1/2013...so after using for a couple months but before my 90 days was up, I just wasn't seeing the results I wanted to see in my breakouts and decided this was too much money to spend on something that was going to sit in my drawer and not work so I contacted Clarisonic to start the return process.  To Clarisonics credit, they didn't question my return or give me any trouble. I had to email them a copy of my receipt and within two days they emailed me a UPS shipping label to return the product. So we'll see how long it takes me to get my refund check. They said it could take up to six weeks but hoping it doesn't take that long."}, "predictions": [{"result": [{"value": {"choices": ["Positive"]}, "id": "data-55701", "from_name": "sentiment", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices"}]}]}, {"data": {"text": "It does not burn my under eye area like some eye creams do."}, "predictions": [{"result": [{"value": {"choices": ["Negative"]}, "id": "data-14841", "from_name": "sentiment", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices"}]}]}, {"data": {"text": "NOT GREAT"}, "predictions": [{"result": [{"value": {"choices": ["Positive"]}, "id": "data-27179", "from_name": "sentiment", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices"}]}]}, {"data": {"text": "It seems to be helping with my thinning hair, but it is very drying."}, "predictions": [{"result": [{"value": {"choices": ["Positive"]}, "id": "data-77731", "from_name": "sentiment", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices"}]}]}, {"data": {"text": "Dries my skin out really bad"}, "predictions": [{"result": [{"value": {"choices": ["Positive"]}, "id": "data-47840", "from_name": "sentiment", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices"}]}]}, {"data": {"text": "Don't care at all for this product.

It's a great moisturizer! I don't think I'll use it as a leave in conditioner because I have long, fine hair and any product added usually just weighs my hair down & makes it feel greasy/heavy. So only reviewing as a skin moisturizer and dang this stuff is awesome! Wish I could underline lol! Awesome because of the smell (I know I'm going to lose a few people here, but I actually like the kind of minty, citronella candle smell), it absorbs quickly and thoroughly, which is definitely something that is hard to find. Even some lotions that say they absorb with no greasy feeling don't cut it and this stuff does! It seems to be helping my eczema! It's almost cleared up my arms and has nearly completely cleared up my hands including some hard, scaly patches that almost look like psoriasis, though I've never been diagnosed with that skin condition. I've used it all over my body and so far my only (very mild) complaint is, it made the skin of my face & neck break out so I will stick to Clinique products on my face, but everywhere else get's a nice, soothing coating of PM Tea Tree Oil Moisturizer. Next time I'm buying industrial size! It's working wonders for the cracks on the heels of my feet. Also just a FYI a little goes a loooong way!

For those of you with long, naturally curly/wavy hair, you understand how critical the concentrator nozzle is when straightening your hair.  My nozzle is now useless.  I called Babyliss Customer service off their website.  The girl I talked to said that Conair (parent company) doesn't carry concentrator nozzles for their professional brands, only the consumer Conair brand.  I was surprised at this, so I confirmed.  Yes- that is correct, we don't carry them and they are not covered under the warranty as a replacement part.  So I said and I quote \" So what you are telling me, is that if one of your customers  purchases a Babyliss blow dryer, and the concentrator nozzle stops working or breaks, that the consumer is out of luck, I have no options\"  Her answer- \"Yes, that is correct\".

The only thing was, lately I've been suspecting that it is not really non comedogenic (it doesn't promise that anyway) and is probably the only reason I still break out. (I noticed my skin gets bad any time I accidentally fall asleep in it.) So I decided to try to find a foundation that had all the same qualities (good natural color, stays on all day, stays matte, good coverage, not cakey) but won't clog my pores. This sounded like the closest thing. Even though it is triple the price, I figured it was worth it because since it has SPF 30, I could stop buying the expensive SPF 30 I usually put on under the Revlon since Revlon only contains an SPF 6. This foundation, besides promising to be non comedogenic, promises to stay put for 16 hours and stay matte. It did neither for me. I only tried it for two days because I wanted to be able to send it back if it wasn't working, but this is how it compared:\nColor: I'm in between super light and tan and sometimes use self tanners. So in Revlon I either use Sand Beige by itself or mix Sand Beige with a lighter color called Buff. Either way looks really good/natural on me and just depends how tan or non tan my body is. So with this one that only comes in a few colors, I bought the nude to try and figured if I liked it I would buy the lighter color opal and mix them when I need it to be lighter. Well, I didn't get that far, but the nude was a little too orange. I asked a friend and she thought it looked fine but I thought it looked too orange/tan to me. I also think it looked different in different lighting so sometimes looked worse than others.\n\nApplying: It definitely went on much lighter and thinner than Revlon Colorstay which was a plus and still covered everything: acne, scars, freckles, etc. And it dried very fast which I like. Sometimes the Revlon doesn't dry fast enough for me when I'm in a hurry to finish my routine. BUT even though it dried, it was shiny. When I powdered it, I may as well not have put any powder at all because it was still pretty shiny. Especially on my forehead and nose. But when I touched it, it was totally dry. So that was kind of weird. I never experienced anything like that before and that's not really a look I like. I've always liked matte looking skin but like my blush to be shimmery - only on my cheeks. When I powder the Revlon it becomes very matte.\n\nThroughout the day: I normally have an oily t zone and with the Revlon Colorstay, the oily t zone starts to come out after 4-5 hours and the rest of my face stays normal. I usually use Clean and Clear oil blotters which would take care of it for another several hours and not take the make up off at all. With the Vichy, I felt like my entire face was getting very oily after only an hour. It's a little hard to tell since it was shiny from the beginning but I definitely could feel a difference too. When I used the oil blotters, the make up actually came off in some spots onto the sheet. So it does not stay put as promised. By the end of my 9 hour work day my jawline was missing and forehead was spotty. (And it's supposed to last 16 hours.) That never happens with the Revlon Colorstay. The second day I tried powdering instead of oil blotting and it was still very spotty, maybe even worse.\n\nThe first day I put it on with nothing underneath. The second day I used a semi expensive mattifying primer on one side of my face and what I consider my very expensive mattifying sunscreen that I normally use, on the other side of my face, to see if it made a difference but it did not. Still super shiny and oily and did not stay entirely on for my 9 hour work day. I was very disappointed because I did go in with high hopes and not wanting to be a skeptic, but I didn't see a reason to test it for a 3rd day. I can't say whether or not it prevented break outs since I didn't use it long enough. I don't want to continue using Revlon Colorstay if it's going to continue to clog my pores so I'll still be searching for something that has all these qualities I need and have to use it in the meantime. Very disappointed.\n\nUpdate: I tried CoverGirl Ready Set Gorgeous foundation and so far I've been liking that one. It's oil free, non pore clogging. I've been using it for over a week and so far haven't had any new breakouts. I even slept in it once. Coverage is surprisingly pretty good, staying power is decent, comes in a wide variety of colors and was a lot more matte than Vichy. And best of all it was only $6.99 at Target. Revlon was still the best make up I've ever used in terms of staying power and staying matte but so far I like how the CoverGirl has many of the good qualities as well as not clogging my pores! And if you don't have acne, you don't need as much of it and won't end up going through the vicious cycle of pore clogging and covering! Highly recommend anyone who is acne prone & oily instead of Vichy."}, "predictions": [{"result": [{"value": {"choices": ["Positive"]}, "id": "data-10458", "from_name": "sentiment", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices"}]}]}, {"data": {"text": "Very difficult to get out of the tube and the hard plastic when rubbing onto your chapped lips is not gentle.

I am an Amazon Prime member so I am always happy to find something that I want that will be at my door in 2 days -- this actually came in one.  (Though that isn't always good when I am trying to hide a purchase!) I couldn't wait to use this dryer so I washed and conditioned my hair the evening it arrived.\n\nI will start off telling you the one reason I didn't give this 4 stars.  Others have mentioned the weight and I will agree that so far this is the heaviest dryer I have ever used.  I am getting better with it the more I use it and that is not enough of an issue that I still don't love it -- but I would imagine my Mom wouldn't like it since she has had carpel tunnel issues in the past.  I hit my head with this dryer the 1st time I used it because I wasn't used to the weight.  Though I am not known for my grace either.\n\nI like to style my hair with only a hairdryer but since I had a mishap with some home hi-lighting, my hair is pretty damaged so it is too frizzy after blow drying because of its current condition that I have had to also use a big curling iron or flat iron to smooth it out.  No More.  I dry it all over which I swear now takes me about 3 minutes - this thing is strong - then I attached the nozzle to smooth and slightly curl my hair under.  Amazing.  My hair is smooth and shiny.  I honestly didn't believe that I would be able to style my hair so quickly and have it look so good.  The first time I used it I had so much volume that it was almost comical.  My hair was a bit too big.  I was used to styling my hair with a lesser dryer and I could tell after one use with this dryer.\n\nA few mentioned the buttons.  I had no issues with them.  I always look at my dryer to see what the heat, speed etc is before using it so it didn't matter to me like others mentioned that you couldn't change your setting without looking.  It's something that doesn't slow me down or matter.  I used it only on high heat with both settings.  I use the lower speed with the nozzle for more precise styling and high heat, high speed for all over drying.  I have never been one to bother with the other settings.\n\nThe price for this hairdryer is great.  I've bought drug store hairdryers that cost $40 to $50 and there is no comparison.  I think it is even a little cheaper now than when I ordered it.  I'm tempted to order a backup.  That tells you how much I love this thing.\n\nIf weight isn't an issue - this is the dryer for you."}, "predictions": [{"result": [{"value": {"choices": ["Negative"]}, "id": "data-62030", "from_name": "sentiment", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices"}]}]}, {"data": {"text": "I've been using for a few weeks and haven't noticed any significant improvement.
